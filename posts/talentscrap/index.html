<div class=post-content><p><strong>Talentscrap</strong> is a web scrapping script i wrote using python and Selenium to extract data from <a href=https://talents.esi.dz/scolar/public_etudiant_list>ESI Talents</a> public profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Selenium</strong> is a great tool which is primarily used to <strong>automate</strong> web browsing interactions for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that and can be used for exemple to <strong>scrap</strong> data.</p>
<h2 id=context>Context<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#context>#</a></h2>
<p>I was following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLroEs25KGvwzmvIxYHRhoGTz9w8LeXek0">course</a> on <strong>databases</strong> architectures and SQL commands.
It was a very good academic course by a professor at Stanford, it helped me getting the essential concepts, but i prefer the project based learning approach, that&rsquo;s why I needed some data to create a database and practice what i learned on it.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to my mind was ESI students data, so i went to <strong>ESI talents</strong> website and found that some students have their profiles public (it contains numerical values, text, images&mldr; everything I needed !), so I decided to scrap that data and use it!</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/img/talentscrap/databaseScheme.png alt=databaseScheme.png>
</p>
<p>The databse scheme is quite simple : i used 2 primary keys (promo,id), with each combination of these two we get a unique student.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to add another table to store students averages, meanwhile, you can find the source code and try it on my github.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2>
<p>After completing this project, many ideas came to mind about automating some repetitive tasks, and making scripts that play online browser based games (like sudoku).</p>
