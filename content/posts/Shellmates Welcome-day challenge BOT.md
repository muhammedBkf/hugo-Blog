Every year, the **clubs** at our campus compete to promote their activities in order to attract **newcomers**.
Each club innovates and tries its best to convince people to join it and get them familiarized with its workflow.

At [Shellmates Club](https://shellmates.club/), we decided to make a **challenge** based on a **discord bot**, in which players can discover the field of Cyber Security and CTF's. In addition to that, it will get them familiarized with our main **working platform**, discord.

# The challenge

## phase 1
We have stuck this **QRcode** in important places on campus, when you scan it, it will redirect you to the **discord server** where you will find the challenge bot.

## phase 3
After completing all the challenges the bot will invite you to our **welcome day** to claim your **gift**.
